## Minimum Viable Product

RoboTask is a web application inspired by Task Rabbit built using Ruby on Rails
and React.js. Hire robots to do stuff for you. Or, Sign up as a robot to do
stuff for people and earn some credits.

RoboTask allows users to:

- [x] Create accounts
- [x] Handle sessions (log in/log out)
- [x] Create, view, edit, and delete tasks
- [x] Receive recommendations for which robot to hire to fulfill a task
- [x] View qualified robot profiles and manually select one to perform a task
- [x] Mark tasks as completed and rate assigned robot's performance (good/bad)
- [x] as task fulfiller, select capable task types, robot qualifications, and available datetimes
- [x] as task fulfiller, accept/cancel assigned task.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication. User and Task Models (2 days)

Phase 1: Build user account signup and login authentication using BCrypt.  On
user signup, user will be directed to a placeholder form for creating a task.

The Task model will have a time slice (start and end dates), description,
creator_id (user who creates the task), and worker_id (user who is assigned to
fulfill the task). Example task: On Oct 13 - Oct 14 I need a robot to watch my
dog.

The User model will have a short bio and own time slices that determine when
they are available for hire. A user who does not work will not own time slices.

Since a time slice is a concept common to both Tasks and Users, the Timeslice
model will be polymorphic and belong to both Tasks and Users as a Timeslicable.

This phase will be focused on fleshing out the models. Next phase will construct
the API utils and actions.

[Details][phase-one]

### Phase 2: Task JSON API, API Utils and API Actions (2 days)

Phase 2: Build JSON APIs for Task and User models. The User JSON API helps task
creators find eligible workers. This API will fetch users who own timeslices
that enclose a given task timeslice; this determines if a user is a valid
candidate for a task assignment. To account for timeslices that a user is
working, this API will consider the user's worked-task time slices as
unavailable times.

The Task JSON API helps workers find unassigned tasks that they are qualified to
fulfill. By default, this API Will fetch unassigned tasks that fall within a
worker user's time slices. The worker has the option to list all unassigned
tasks.

[Details][phase-two]

### Phase 3: Flux Architecture, Views, Stores, Routes. Task CRUD. Basic bootstrap. (2.5 days)

Phase 3: I will set up the Flux architecture, Stores, React Router and Views for
the base application. First, I will set up the User and Task store. The user
store will track worker user availability. The task store will track open Task
availability.

Next, I will create the React View to display all available workers for a given
task (WorkerIndex), which consists of several workers (WorkerIndexItem).
A React View to display all available tasks for a given worker user will be
shown with the (TasksIndex), which consists of several tasks (TaskIndexItem).

I will create forms (TaskForm, WorkerUserForm) to let users submit and accept
tasks, respectively. Task creators can submit the task without choosing a worker
user (TaskBestChoice, random selection), or can select a particular qualified
worker user(TaskChooseWorker).

I will start using bootstrap to create a consistent style and flow to the
application. I will add persistent seed data to populate the user database,
tasktypes, qualifications. I will also add tasks having colorful flavor text.

[Details][phase-three]

### Phase 4: Add review system (2 days)

Phase 4: I will add a review system for tasks. When a task is completed, the
task creator can rate the respective worker's job performance and fill in an
optional review text component. These reviews will feed into the worker user
show page as an overall satisfaction percentage to help task creators choose
which worker user to select for a task.  

[Details][phase-four]

### Phase 5: Tasktype, and Qualifications Models. (2 days)

Phase 5: This section may end up as a bonus depending on project timing.
I will build the Tasktype and Qualification Models which add another layer of
organization for tasks. Tasks belong_to a Tasktype (ex: delivery, guard duty,
tutoring), and has_many Qualifications (ex: extra storage module, jetpack,
cloaking). An example task: someone who wants a robot for a delivery Tasktype
might require a robot with a jetpack for extra mobility, as well as an extra
storage module for increased carrying capacity.

Similar to the tasks, each worker user will has_many Tasktypes that they can
perform and also will has_many Qualifications. A worker user will be considered
a valid applicant for a task if the worker_user.tasktypes.include?(task.tasktype)
&& worker_user.qualifications.include?(task.qualifications).

[Details][phase-five]

### Phase 6: Styling Cleanup and addtional seeding (1 day)

Phase 6: Adjust CSS of specific elements to have better application flow. Add
additional transitions where to frequently accessed elements. I will add
persistent seed data to populate the user database, tasktypes, qualifications.
I will also add tasks having colorful flavor text.

### Phase 7 (Bonus): Add notification/message system

Phase 7: I will add a notification system that is triggered when a task is
assigned to a worker user and when a task is completed. After an assignment
event, a notification will be automatically sent from the task creator to the
worker user, and vice versa, as a reminder for an accepted contract. When a task
is marked as completed (whether finished successfully or canceled), a
notification is sent to the task creator and worker user. Users will be able to
mark notifications as read, hidden, and deleted.

This involves creating a Notifications model, JSON Api and ApiActions, Store and
React view. Notification deletions from the database will be determined at the
model level, when both sender and receiver mark it as deleted. Integrate as a
drop down menu.

### Phase 8 (Bonus): Allow worker users to view all tasks on map in particular geofence

Phase 7: Use Google Maps API to allow worker users to view all available tasks
based on location. Can filter tasks based on certain TaskTypes, Qualifications,
and datetimes.

### Bonus Features (TBD)
- [ ] Make nicer transitions
- [ ] Task creators can schedule tasks to be fulfilled on a periodic basis (daily, weekly, etc.)
- [ ] Task fulfillers can view a map that displays tasks via google maps API and allows task view on click
- [ ] Task fulfillers can automatically adjust payrate depending on which qualifications are requested
- [ ] Task fulfillers can separate availability datetimes based on task type
